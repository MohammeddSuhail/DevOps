Pipelines in Azure DevOps typically require an agent pool to run. The agents in the pool execute the tasks defined in your pipeline, such as building code, 
running tests, and deploying applications. Without an agent pool, there would be no agents available to perform these tasks.

An agent pool in Azure DevOps is a collection of agents that are used to run your pipelines. 
Instead of managing each agent individually, you organize them into pools. When you configure an agent, it is registered with a single pool, and 
when you create a pipeline, you specify the pool in which the pipeline runs. This allows you to share the agent machines across projects within your organization



You can find the definition and the specific agents (nodes/servers) that belong to the xxx-xxx-agent-pool within your Azure DevOps project settings.
Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.
Go to Project Settings (usually a gear icon in the bottom left).
Under the Pipelines section, click on Agent pools.
Find and click on the pool named xxx-xxx-agent-pool.
Go to the Agents tab within the pool's settings.
