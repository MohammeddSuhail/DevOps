Network Security Groups:
• Designed to filter traffic to (inbound) and from (outbound) Azure resources located in - Azure Virtual Network
• Filtering controlled by rules
• Ablity to have multiple inbound and outbound rules
 Rules are created by specifying
  • Source/Destination (IP addresses, service tags, application security groups)
  • Protocol (TCP, UDP, any)
  • Port (or Port Ranges, ex. 3389 - RDP, 22 - SSH, 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPS)
  • Direction (inbound or outbound)
  • Priority (order of evaluation)


Application Security Groups:
• Feature that allows grouping of virtual machines located in Azure virtual network
• Designed to reduce the maintenance effort (assign ASG instead of the explicit IP address)

Application Security Groups will usually be inside Network Security Groups.









Routing:
Process of finding/selecting a path for traffic in one or across multiple networks.

User-defined Routes(UDR):
• Custom (user-defined, static) routes (UDRs)
• Designed to override Azure's default routing or add new routes
• Managed via Azure Route Table resource
• Associated with a zero or more Virtual Network subnets









Firewall:
Firewall is a network security service that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic.

Azure Firewall:
• Managed, cloud-based firewall service (PaaS, Firewall as a Service)
• Built-in high availability
• Highly Scalable
• Inbound & outbound traffic filtering rules
• Support for FQDN (Fully Qualifed Domain Name), ex. microsoft.com
• Fully integrated with Azure monitor for logging and analytics









DoS - Denial of Service:
Cyber-attack with intent to cause temporary or indefinite disruption of service

DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service:
DoS attack that is originating from multiple servers

Azure DDoS Protection:
• DDoS protection service in Azure
• Designed to
  • Detect malicious traffic and block it while allowing legitimate users to connect
  • Prevent additional costs for auto-scaling environments
• Two tiers
  • Basic - automatically enabled for Azure platform (all publicly exposed Azure services are already protected by DDoS protection basic plan.)
  • Standard - additional mitigation & monitoring capabilities for Azure Virtual Network resources
• Standard tier uses machine learning to analyze traffic patterns for better accuracy













Identity:
• A user with a username and password.
• Also applications or other servers with secret keys or certificates.
• The fact of being something or someone.

Authentication:
The process of verification/assertion of identity

Authorization:
The process of ensuring that only authenticated identities get access to the resources for which they have been
granted access.

Access Management:
The process of controlling, verifying, tracking and managing access to authorized users and applications.


Azure Active Directory:
• Identity and Access Management service in Azure
• Identities management - users, groups, applications
• Access management - subscriptions, resource groups, roles, role assignments, authentication & authorization
settings, etc.
• Used by multiple Microsoft cloud platforms
  • Azure
  • Microsoft 365
  • Office 365
  • Live.com services (Skype, OneDrive, etc.) 

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):
• Process of authentication using more than one factor (evidence) to prove identity
• Factor types
  • Knowledge Factor - "Something you know", ex. password, pin
  • Possession Factor - "Something you have", ex. phone, token, card, key
  • Physical Characteristic Factor - "Something you are", ex. fingerprint, voice, face, eye iris
  • Location Factor - "Somewhere you are", ex. GPS location
• Supported by Azure AD by default (simple on-off switch)













Azure Security Center:
Azure Security Center is a service that protects Azure laaS and PaaS services by providing a centralized
and unified experience with recommendations and advanced security features.
Security Center includes features like 
 • security recommendations
 • monitoring for cloud and on-premises workloads
 • automatic security assessments, analysis of threats and attacks, 
 • just-in-time VMaccess, and many more.

• Centralized/unified infrastructure and platform security management service
• Natively embedded in Azure services
• Integrated with Azure Advisor
• Two tiers
  • Free (Azure Defender OFF) - included in all Azure services, provides continuous assessments, security
    score, and actionable security recommendations
  • Paid (Azure Defender ON) - hybrid security, threat protection alerts, vulnerability scanning, just in time (JIT) VM access, etc.

Security Center was the one who was providing recommendentions to the Azure Advisor












Azure Key Vault:
• Managed service for securing sensitive information (application/platform) (PaaS)
• Secure storage service for
  • Keys,
  • Secrets and
  • Certificates
• Highly integrated with other Azure services (VMs, Logic Apps, Data Factory, Web Apps, etc.)
• Centralization
• Access monitoring and logging











What is a Role?
Role (role definition) is a collection of actions that the assigned identity will be able to perform.
Role definition is an answer to a question "What can be done?"

What is a Security Principal?
Security Principal is an Azure object (identity) that I can be assigned to a role (ex. users, groups or applications).
Security Principal assignment is an answer to a question "Who can do it?"
Scope - resource, resource groups, subscription, management group

What is a Scope?
Scope is one or more Azure resources that the access applies to.
Scope assignment is an answer to a question "Where can it be done?"

What is a Role Assignment?
Role assignment is a combination of the role definition, security principal and scope.


Azure Role-based Access Control (RBAC):
• Authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
• Designed for fine-grained access management of Azure Resources
• Role assignment is combination of
  • Role definition - list of permissions like create VM, delete SQL, assign permissions, etc.
  • Security Principal - user, group, service principal and managed identity and
  • Scope - resource, resource groups, subscription, management group
• Hierarchical
   Management Groups > Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources
• Built-in and Custom roles are supported













Azure Resource Lock:
• Designed to prevent accidental deletion and/or modification
• Used in conjunction with RBAC
• Two types of locks
  • Read-only (ReadOnly) - only read actions are allowed
  • Delete (CanNotDelete) - all actions except delete are allowed
• Scopes are hierarchical (inherited)
   Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources
• Management Groups can't be locked
• Only Owner and User Access Administrator roles can manage locks (built-in roles)












Azure Resource Tags:
• Tags are simple Name (key) - Value pairs
• Designed to help with organization of Azure resources
• Used for resource governance, security, operations management, cost management, automation, etc.
• Typical tagging strategies
  • Functional - mark by function (ex: environment = production)
  • Classification - mark by policies used ( ex: classification = restricted)
  • Finance/Accounting - mark for billing purposes ( ex: department = finance )
  • Partnership - mark by association of users/groups ( ex: owner = adam )
• Applicable for resources, resource groups and subscriptions
• NOT inherited by default(i.e, if a resource grp has a tag, that doesn't mean that all the rsc's in that rsc grp will be applied that tag)
  but there is a policy that could allow the interitence of resource tags














Azure Policy:
• Designed to help with resource governance, security, compliance, cost management, etc.
• Azure Policy inspects properties of Azure resources using simple if/else conditions and allows customers to
  choose actions (effects) based on their values.(unlike RBAC which focused on user actions)
• Policy definition - Defines what should happen
  • Define the condition (if/else) and the effect (deny, audit, append, modify, etc.)
  • Examples include allowed resource types, allowed locations, allowed SKUs, inherit resource tags
• Built-in and custom policies are supported
• Policy initiative - a group of policy definitions
• Policy assignment - assignment of a policy definition/initiative to a scope
  • Scopes can be assigned to
    • management groups,
    • subscriptions,
    • resource groups, and
    • resources
• Policies allow for exclusions of scopes(can exclude resources from policies being applied to it)
• Checked during resource creation or updates and existing ones with remediation tasks
ex: like policy for restricting the region location of resources
First the normal in-built policies are applied, later our created policies will be applied.













Azure Blueprints:
Blueprints service was designed to provide a centralized approach for the management of approved design pattern for your organization.
• Package of various Azure components (artifacts)
  • Resource Groups
  • ARM Templates
  • Policy Assignments
  • Role Assignments
• Centralized storage for organizationally approved design patterns
• Blueprint definition - describing what should happen (reusable package)
• Blueprint assignment - describing where it should happen (package deployment)










Cloud Adoption Framework:
• Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) for Azure is a set of tools, best practices, guidelines anddocumentation
• Stages
  • Strategy - understand why move and how to provide business value
  • Plan - prepare actionable plan based on current digital assets and supporting current strategy
  • Ready - prepare and align users, processes and environment (azure landing zone)
  • Adopt - start move (migrate/innovate) based on the plan (implement the plan)
  • Govern - align compliance and security standards and tools
  • Manage - manage, monitor and optimize environment
• Organize - ensure everyone knows what to do and when (RACI matrix)
• Documentation and communication of every stage is critical requirement for the process

Plan, Ready and Adopt are 3 main stages of cloud adoption process.
