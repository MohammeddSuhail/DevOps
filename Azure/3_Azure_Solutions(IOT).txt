Designed for event-based and near-real time applications
Supports dozen of built-in events from most common Azure services











DevOps:

• Azure DevOps:
Collection of services for building solutions using DevOps practices
Services included
  • Boards – tracking work
  • Pipelines – building CI/CD workflows (build, test and deploy apps)
  • Repos – code collaboration and versioning with Git
  • Test Plans – manual and exploratory testing
  • Artifacts – manage project deliverables
Extensible with Marketplace – over 1000 of available apps

• Azure DevTest Labs:
Service for creation of sandbox environments for developers/testers (PaaS)
Quick setup of self-managed virtual machines
Preconfigured templates for VMs
Plenty of additional artifacts (tools, apps, custom actions)
Lab policies (quotas, sizes, auto-shutdowns)
Share and automate labs via custom images
Premade plugins/API/tools for CI/CD pipeline automation



Azure DevTest labs is used to provide sandbox environments to developers and testers but it doesn't
deliver any features for building CI/CD pipelines.

Azure DevOps comes with a pipelines feature that allow developers to create CI/CD pipelines for their
applications easily.
