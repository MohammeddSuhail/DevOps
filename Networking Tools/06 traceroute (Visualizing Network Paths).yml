Traceroute is used to trace the route that packets take from your device to a target destination (such as a server or website). 
It shows each hop (or router) the packets pass through, helping to identify network delays, bottlenecks, or routing issues.

Purpose: 
To understand the path packets take across the network and identify potential points of failure or delay.
