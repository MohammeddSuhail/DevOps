lsof stands for List Open Files, and it is a command-line tool used in Unix-like operating systems 
(such as Linux and macOS) to list information about files that are currently open by processes. 
Since, in Unix-like systems, almost everything is treated as a file (including devices, sockets, pipes, etc.), lsof is useful for a wide range of tasks involving file and resource management.


List all open files:
lsof
This command lists all the open files by all processes. It can result in a lot of output, as it shows every file opened by all processes on the system.

Find which process is using a specific file:
lsof /path/to/file
This shows which processes have the file /path/to/file open.

List open files by a specific user:
lsof -u username
This shows the files opened by processes owned by username.

List open files for a specific process:
lsof -p <pid>
Replace <pid> with the process ID of the application you want to check. This lists the files opened by the process with that ID.

Show open network connections:
lsof -i
This shows all open network connections (TCP and UDP). It’s useful for seeing which ports are being used and by which processes.
ex: 
lsof -i:port_no
lsof -i tcp
lsof -i udp

Show open files on a specific port:
lsof -i :80
This shows which processes are using port 80 (commonly used for HTTP).

List open files and their respective processes:
lsof -t
This shows only the process IDs (PIDs) of the processes that have open files.

Find Files Opened by a Specific User’s Process:
lsof -u user_name -a -p PID

Show All Open Files in a Specific Directory:
lsof +D /path/to/directory


Output Breakdown:
The output of lsof typically contains several columns, including:
COMMAND: The name of the command/process.
PID: The Process ID.
USER: The user who owns the process.
FD: The file descriptor (e.g., cwd for current working directory, txt for program text, etc.).
TYPE: The type of file (e.g., REG for regular file, DIR for directory, IPv4 for internet connection).
DEVICE: The device on which the file is stored.
SIZE/OFF: The size of the file or the offset (for open files).
NODE: The inode number.
NAME: The name of the file or resource being used.
