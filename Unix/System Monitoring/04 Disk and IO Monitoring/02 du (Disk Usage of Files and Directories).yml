du â€“ Disk Usage of Files and Directories
Shows how much disk space is used by files and directories.

When to Use:
To identify which directories/files are consuming the most space.
Useful for cleanup and space optimization.

Usage:
du -h <folder>

ex:
du -h --max-depth=1 /home
Shows disk usage for directories in /home.

ex:
du -sh /var/*
Summarizes the size of each folder in /var.
s: Summarizes the total disk usage of the specified directory and does not display the usage of individual subdirectories.

ex:
du -hd1
-h: Stands for "human-readable" and displays sizes in a format that is easier to read (e.g., KB, MB, GB).
-d1: Limits the depth of the directory tree to one level, meaning it will only show the sizes of the current directory and its immediate subdirectories.
