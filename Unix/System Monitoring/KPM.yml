Key Performance Metrics(KPMs):
Response Time: Measures the time taken to respond to a request. Understanding factors affecting response time, such as latency, server load, and network conditions, is important.
Throughput: The amount of work processed in a given time period, often measured in requests per second, transactions per minute, etc.
Resource Utilization: Monitoring CPU, memory, disk, and network usage to identify potential resource constraints or inefficiencies.
Error Rates: Track the frequency of errors in the system, including application failures, failed database queries, network issues, etc.
