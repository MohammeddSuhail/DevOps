Swap space in Linux is a portion of the disk that is used as virtual memory when the physical RAM (Random Access Memory) is full. 
When the system runs out of RAM, it moves inactive memory pages to the swap space, freeing up RAM for active processes.







Increasing Swpap Space in Linux:


Method 1: Creating a Swap File (Recommended)

1. Create a swap file (e.g., 4GB swap file):
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
or
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096

2. Set correct permissions:
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

3. Format the file as swap:
sudo mkswap /swapfile

4. Enable the swap file:
sudo swapon /swapfile

5. Make it permanent (so it persists after reboot): Add the following line to /etc/fstab:
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0



Method 2: Adding a Swap Partition (For Systems with Unused Disk Space)



Method 2: Adding a Swap Partition (For Systems with Unused Disk Space)

1. Use fdisk or gparted to create a new partition.

2. Change its type to Linux swap (82).

3. Format it as swap:
sudo mkswap /dev/sdX

4. Enable swap:
sudo swapon /dev/sdX

5. Add it to /etc/fstab for persistence.
