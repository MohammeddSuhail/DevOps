CPU Monitoring:

top or htop: Real-time system monitoring
Displays real-time system information including CPU, memory, swap, and running processes.


mpstat: 
CPU usage across all cores. Great for identifying multi-core CPU bottlenecks.
ex: mpstat 2 5
    where:
        2: Interval in seconds.
        5: Number of reports.
Gives.
%usr: CPU time spent on user processes.
%sys: CPU time on kernel processes.
%idle: Idle CPU time.


pidstat: Per-process CPU usage over time
Tracks CPU, memory, and I/O usage per process over a time interval
ex: pidstat 2 5
    where:
        2: Interval in seconds.
        5: Number of reports.
Gives,
%usr: User-level CPU usage per process.
%system: Kernel-level CPU usage per process.
%CPU: Total CPU usage per process.
