Recursive search for text:
grep -r "search_pattern" <path_to_search>
case insensitive search:
grep -ir "global" Unix/


grep (Global Regular Expression Pattern):
This command is used for searching a required pattern in a file.


^ : Represents starting of the line
$ : Represents end of the line



-o: for matching the pattern and returning only the matched pattern
grep -o "Data are: [0-9]*, [0-9]*, [0-9]*" some_file


Display all lines that start with 'D'.
grep '^D' cities


Display all lines that ends with with 'i'
grep 'i$' cities


Display all lines that end with "bad"
grep 'bad$' cities


Display all lines that contain any of the letters A,B,C,D.
grep '[A-D]' cities
or
grep '[ABCD]' cities


Search for vowels in the file a,e, i,o, u
grep '[aeiou]' cities


Search for consonants in the file (Other than a, e, i,o, u)
grep "[^aeiou]" cities



Search for multiple patterns:
-e : Search for multiple patterns.
ex:
grep -e "Delhi" -e "Chennai" cities




egrep:
Instead of 'e' we can use egrep command.
egrep "(Delhi|Chennai)" cities



Difference between grep & egrep:

works:
egrep "(Delhi|Chennai)" cities
doesn't work:
grep "(Delhi|Chennai)" cities

grep command understand patterns but not all
egrep command understand all the patterns.





-F search for fixed strings (No pattern):
ex: grep -F "Delhi" cities
ex:
grep -F "Delhi
Mumbai
Hyderabad" cities






fgrep: search for fixed strings (No pattern)
ex: fgrep "Delhi" cities
ex:
fgrep "Delhi
Mumbai
Hyderabad" cities




listing files start with emp using pipeline:
ls | grep '^emp'
