artifact:
The files that contain both the compiled code and the resources that are used to compile them are known as artifacts. They are readily deployable files.
In java an artifact would be a .jar, war, .ear file
In NPM the artifact file would be a .tar.g file
In .NET the artifact file would be a .dil file



artifact repository:
An artifact repository is a repository which can store multiple different versions of artifacts. Each
time the war file or tar.gz file is created it is stored in server dedicated for the artifacts.



if a new version of artifact fails in deployment then we can just pull back the new_version_of_the_artifact_that_failed and then lauch the previous version of the build



Nexus Repository: is a artifact repository manager and depenedency manager
is a tool used in DevOps methodology for multiple purposes. One of it's main purpose is to store artifacts(readily deployable code) that have been created in the code pipeline.
Another one of it's purpose is to act as a sort of buffer for downloading dependencies for the build tools and languages.

Basically stores artifact and deploys based on need and manages & downloads the dependencies for the build tool





3rd party and open-source resources are provided by proxying them in nexus(something like that)






Proxy repository is for using thrid party site resource in secure way(only way)
If the coonection is https to the site then we need the certiicates(that site certificate) as well.
If the connection is http then no certificate is needed. 
There's a video explaining this.
