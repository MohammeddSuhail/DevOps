Maven is a popular build automation tool for Java-based projects that helps manage and organize
the software development process.
It provides a standard way to define project dependencies, build processes, and project structure,
making it easier for developers to manage and maintain complex Java applications.
Maven uses a declarative approach to configuration and relies on XML files called "pom.xml" to
describe the project's structure, dependencies, and build process
It also offers a vast repository of open-source libraries and plugins that can be easily integrated into
projects.
