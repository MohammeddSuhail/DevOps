Step a:
In the jenkins job, fill up the following info under Source Code Management
Repository URL: 
ssh link of git repo.
ex: git@github.com:MohammeddSuhail/Ansible.git

Credentials: -none-

Step b:
Now create ssh private and public keys using ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "key label" via git bash shell. 
The ssh private and public keys go under .ssh directory of your logged in user directory. 
Just copy the .ssh folder and paste it under C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile

Step c:
Add your public key to your GIT server account. 
Run the jenkins job and now you should be able to connect to the GIT account via ssh from jenkins.
